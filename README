multi2singlecue - Utility to convert multi-bin bin/cue to single-bin

Does not handle any audio formats, not even wav, just bins.

USAGE: multi2singlecue <in-cue> <out-cue> <out-bin>

Building it requires the Musepack libcuefile available from:
https://musepack.net/index.php?pg=src

Should work fine on any of linux, mac, windows or anything really.
